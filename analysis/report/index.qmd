*Transforming standalone documentation into
reproducible, discoverable blog posts.*

# Introduction

I did not really know how to convert standalone
markdown documentation into a professional blog
post until I sat down with a well-written
technical reference and tried to publish it
through my Quarto site. The document was clear,
had working code examples, and covered its topic
thoroughly. Yet it sat as a flat file on my disk,
invisible to anyone who might benefit from it.

The gap between a markdown file and a published
blog post turned out to be narrower than I
expected, but only if you follow a systematic
workflow. The ZZCOLLAB framework provides the
scaffolding: symlinks bridge Quarto's expectations
with the rrtools research compendium layout, and
a reproducible Docker environment ensures that
readers can rebuild the post from source.

This post documents that conversion workflow from
start to finish, including the decisions you need
to make, the directory structure you need to
create, and the verification steps that prevent
broken links and missing images from reaching your
audience.

## Motivations

- I had several hundred-line markdown documents
  sitting in project directories that no one
  outside the project would ever find.
- Search engines cannot index a markdown file on a
  local disk; a published blog post reaches a
  broader audience.
- I wanted a repeatable process so that converting
  future documentation would take minutes rather
  than hours.
- The ZZCOLLAB dual-symlink system was already
  solving the Quarto-versus-rrtools path conflict,
  and I wanted to document how to use it for
  documentation conversion specifically.
- I needed a pre-publication checklist to prevent
  the embarrassment of publishing posts with
  broken image paths and missing YAML fields.

## Objectives

1. Walk through the complete workflow for
   converting a standalone markdown file into a
   ZZCOLLAB-compatible Quarto blog post.
2. Explain the dual-symlink system that reconciles
   Quarto's directory expectations with the rrtools
   research compendium layout.
3. Provide concrete guidance on YAML frontmatter,
   media asset management, and content adaptation.
4. Deliver a pre-publication checklist covering
   content, metadata, media, structure, and
   testing.

I am documenting my learning process here. If you
spot errors or have better approaches, please let
me know.

*A structured workflow turns documentation into
discoverable content.*

# Prerequisites and Setup

You will need the following tools installed before
starting:

**Required:**

- ZZCOLLAB framework (installed and accessible via
  `zzcollab` command)
- Quarto (for rendering `.qmd` files to HTML)
- Git (for version control)
- Bash shell (macOS or Linux)

**Optional but useful:**

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for automation
- Docker (for full reproducibility)
- A local Quarto preview server

**Background assumed:** Familiarity with markdown
syntax, basic command-line operations, and the
concept of symlinks. No prior experience with
ZZCOLLAB is required; this post covers
initialisation from scratch.

# What is the ZZCOLLAB Blog Workflow?

The ZZCOLLAB blog workflow is a systematic process
for converting standalone markdown documentation
into a Quarto blog post that lives inside a
reproducible research compendium. At its core, it
solves a path conflict: Quarto expects blog posts
at `posts/*/index.qmd`, while rrtools places
authored content in `analysis/paper/`. The
dual-symlink system bridges both conventions so
that a single source file satisfies both tools.

Think of it as a translation layer. Your markdown
content goes into the rrtools-standard location.
Symlinks at the project root make Quarto believe
the file is where it expects. Image paths like
`media/images/hero.jpg` resolve correctly from
both locations because symlinks exist in both
directions.

The workflow itself takes roughly 40 minutes from
start to finish: five minutes for assessment,
three for initialisation, one for symlink setup,
ten for content conversion, five for media assets,
three for metadata, five for testing, and two for
committing.

# Getting Started

## Step 1: Assess Your Source Document

Before touching any tools, spend five minutes
evaluating the markdown file you plan to convert.
Ask yourself:

1. How long is the document? A 200-line reference
   differs from a 600-line tutorial.
2. Does it contain code examples? If so, in which
   languages?
3. Does it need images? Hero images, diagrams,
   screenshots?
4. Is it a tutorial, reference guide, or how-to?
5. Who is the target audience?

```
Example assessment:
- Length: ~600 lines (substantial)
- Code: Yes (bash scripts, R snippets)
- Images: Yes (hero + concept diagram)
- Type: How-to guide with reference sections
- Audience: R developers using ZZCOLLAB
- Estimate: 10 minutes to convert content
```

## Step 2: Create the ZZCOLLAB Project

```bash
cd ~/prj/qblog/posts
mkdir my_blog_post && cd my_blog_post
zzcollab -r ubuntu_standard_publishing
```

This creates the standard project structure:
`analysis/`, `R/`, `tests/`, a Dockerfile,
`renv.lock`, a Makefile, and
`.zzcollab/manifest.json`.

## Step 3: Set Up the Dual-Symlink System

```bash
./modules/setup_symlinks.sh
```

This creates symlinks at two levels:

**At the project root** (for Quarto discovery):

```
index.qmd  -> analysis/paper/index.qmd
figures/   -> analysis/figures/
media/     -> analysis/media/
data/      -> analysis/data/
```

**Inside `analysis/paper/`** (for intuitive
editing):

```
figures/ -> ../figures/
media/   -> ../media/
data/    -> ../data/
```

The dual-symlink design means that when you write
`![](media/images/hero.jpg)` in your blog post,
the path resolves correctly whether Quarto renders
from the project root or you preview from
`analysis/paper/`.

common blog post failures.*

# Converting Your Content

## YAML Frontmatter

Replace the template YAML with metadata specific
to your post. The fields that matter most for blog
listing display are `title`, `categories`,
`description`, and `image`:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
subtitle: "Clarifying subtitle"
author: "Your Name"
date: "2025-12-02"
categories: [quarto, zzcollab, workflow, reproducibility]
description: "2-3 sentence summary."
image: "media/images/hero.jpg"
document-type: "blog"
draft: true
execute:
  echo: true
  warning: false
  message: false
format:
  html:
    code-fold: false
    code-tools: false
---
```

Key points:

- Keep titles under 70 characters and include
  searchable keywords.
- Use 2-4 categories drawn from your blog's
  existing taxonomy.
- The `description` field appears in blog listings;
  lead with the value proposition.
- Set `draft: true` during development.

## Adapting Markdown to Quarto

Most markdown syntax transfers directly. The main
conversions to consider:

- **Blockquotes** become Quarto callouts:

```qmd
::: {.callout-note}
## Summary
Your key takeaway goes here.
:::
```

- **Code blocks** should specify a language for
  syntax highlighting (`bash`, `r`, `python`).
- **Images** use the `.img-fluid` class for
  responsive display.

## Adding Media Assets

Copy images into the media directory and document
their sources:

```bash
cp ~/path/to/hero.jpg \
  analysis/media/images/hero.jpg

cat > analysis/media/images/README.md << 'EOF'
# Image Attribution

## hero.jpg
- Source: Unsplash
- Photographer: [Name]
- Licence: Unsplash Licence
- URL: [link]
EOF
```

Reference images in your post with relative paths:

```qmd
![Alt text](media/images/hero.jpg){.img-fluid}

*Caption with attribution.*
```

# Integration with the Parent Blog

The parent Quarto blog configuration
(`_quarto.yml`) already renders posts matching the
pattern `posts/*/index.qmd`. Because the root-level
symlink maps `index.qmd` to
`analysis/paper/index.qmd`, the blog discovers
your post automatically.

No changes to the parent blog configuration are
required. When you render the entire site with
`quarto render`, the new post appears in the
listing.

# Version Control

Commit your work with a descriptive message that
documents the content, media assets, and
reproducibility infrastructure:

```bash
cd ~/prj/qblog/posts/my_blog_post
git add .
git status
git commit -m "Add blog post: Your Post Title

- analysis/paper/index.qmd: Main content
- analysis/media/images/: Hero and diagrams
- Dockerfile + renv.lock: Reproducible env"
```

Git handles symlinks correctly; they are stored as
text files containing the target path.

# Testing and Validation

## Quick Validation

```bash
ls -la index.qmd
head -25 analysis/paper/index.qmd
grep "images/" analysis/paper/index.qmd
```

## Local Render

```bash
cd ~/prj/qblog/posts/my_blog_post
quarto render analysis/paper/index.qmd
open index.html
```

Common issues and fixes:

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `index.qmd not found` | Broken symlink | `ls -la index.qmd` |
| Image not found | Wrong path | Use `media/images/file.jpg` |
| YAML parse error | Tabs in YAML | Use spaces only |
| No highlighting | Missing language | Specify ` ```bash ` |

## Things to Watch Out For

1. **Symlinks break after cloning.** If someone
   clones your repository and the symlinks do not
   recreate correctly, they must run
   `setup_symlinks.sh` again or recreate them
   manually.
2. **Tabs in YAML cause silent failures.** Quarto
   YAML requires spaces for indentation. A single
   tab character produces a parse error that does
   not always point to the offending line.
3. **Absolute image paths break portability.** Always
   use relative paths (`media/images/hero.jpg`),
   never absolute paths. Absolute paths work on
   your machine and nowhere else.
4. **The `draft` field defaults to `false` when
   omitted.** If you forget to set `draft: true`,
   your unfinished post appears on the public site
   after the next render.
5. **Large images slow rendering and page load.**
   Keep images under 500 KB each. Use JPEG for
   photographs and PNG for diagrams with sharp
   edges.

deployment failures.*

## Lessons Learnt

### Conceptual Understanding

- The dual-symlink system is the single most
  important architectural decision in the workflow;
  it reconciles two competing directory conventions
  without requiring changes to either tool.
- Blog posts are more discoverable than standalone
  markdown files; the effort of conversion pays off
  in audience reach.
- Structured YAML metadata enables Quarto's listing
  features (search, category filtering, date
  sorting) without custom JavaScript.
- The rrtools research compendium layout provides a
  natural separation between authored content,
  analysis code, and media assets.

### Technical Skills

- Setting up symlinks with `ln -s` and verifying
  them with `ls -la` became second nature after
  the first conversion.
- Writing Quarto callouts
  (`::: {.callout-note} ... :::`) replaced
  blockquotes for emphasis and improved visual
  hierarchy.
- The `.img-fluid` class in Bootstrap ensures
  images scale correctly on mobile without any
  custom CSS.
- Using `quarto render` for local preview before
  committing caught broken paths that would
  otherwise reach the public site.

### Gotchas and Pitfalls

- I initially forgot to document image sources in
  `analysis/media/images/README.md` and had to
  reconstruct attribution after the fact.
- A missing `.img-fluid` class caused one hero
  image to overflow its container on mobile
  devices.
- I once committed a post with `draft: false` by
  accident and discovered it live on the site
  before correcting the metadata.
- Quarto's error messages for broken image paths
  are sometimes vague; `grep` for all image
  references before rendering saves debugging time.

## Limitations

- This workflow assumes a Unix-like environment
  (macOS or Linux) for symlink support. Windows
  users may need WSL or alternative approaches.
- The 40-minute estimate applies to straightforward
  documentation with minimal code and few images.
  Complex tutorials with interactive elements take
  longer.
- The dual-symlink system adds conceptual
  complexity that may confuse contributors
  unfamiliar with the convention.
- ZZCOLLAB must be installed and functional before
  starting. Troubleshooting ZZCOLLAB itself is
  outside the scope of this workflow.
- The workflow does not cover adding R analysis
  pipelines to posts that are purely narrative;
  extending a documentation post with data analysis
  requires additional steps.
- Local rendering requires Quarto installed on the
  author's machine. Docker-based rendering is
  possible but adds setup time.

## Opportunities for Improvement

1. Create a shell script that automates the entire
   workflow: directory creation, ZZCOLLAB
   initialisation, symlink setup, and YAML
   template population from command-line arguments.
2. Build a validation script that checks all image
   paths, verifies symlink integrity, and confirms
   YAML field completeness before rendering.
3. Add a `make convert` target to the Makefile that
   accepts a source markdown path and performs the
   conversion automatically.
4. Develop a Quarto extension that validates
   `document-type` metadata and warns when required
   sections are missing.
5. Create a companion post covering the reverse
   workflow: extracting documentation from an
   existing blog post into a standalone reference.
6. Implement automated image optimisation (resizing,
   compression) as part of the media asset pipeline.

# Wrapping Up

Converting standalone markdown documentation into
a ZZCOLLAB blog post is a systematic, repeatable
process that takes roughly 40 minutes once you
understand the workflow. The dual-symlink system
bridges the gap between Quarto's directory
expectations and the rrtools research compendium
layout, and proper YAML metadata ensures your
content is discoverable through search and category
filtering.

What I learnt most from developing this workflow is
that the barrier to publishing is not the
conversion itself but the lack of a structured
process. Once the steps are documented and the
checklist is in place, each subsequent conversion
is faster and less error-prone.

If you have documentation sitting in project
directories that could benefit a broader audience,
I encourage you to try this workflow. The initial
investment in understanding the symlink system pays
dividends every time you convert another document.

Main takeaways:

- The dual-symlink system is the architectural
  foundation; understand it first.
- YAML metadata drives discoverability; invest time
  in titles, descriptions, and categories.
- A pre-publication checklist prevents the most
  common failures.
- The entire process takes about 40 minutes from
  assessment to committed post.
